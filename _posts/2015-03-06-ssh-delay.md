When I used latest Ubuntu 14.04, I always experienced very large delay (several seconds) when using SSH login.  
This is because OpenSSH tries to get hostname of login IP address via DNS PTR records (to idenfity whether it is a legal IP address).

For example, if the IP address of last login is 143.89.210.233, it will show `Last login: Fri Mar  6 21:08:27 2015 from wf210-233.ust.hk`.
Note that wf210-233.ust.hk is actually the hostname of 143.89.210.233.

To remove this delay, you need to add  `UseDNS no`  to  `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Then restart ssh service with `service ssh restart`.

Btw, if you want to enable ssh root access, add (or modify)  'PermitRootLogin yes' to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and restart ssh service.
