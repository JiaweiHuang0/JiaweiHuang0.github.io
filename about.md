I am Wei Bai (&#x767D;&#x5DCD;), a Ph.D. student in <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>,
<a href="http://www.ust.hk">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a>. 
I work with <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~kaichen/">Prof. Kai Chen</a> in <a href="http://sing.cse.ust.hk">SING</a> Group. 
Before that, I received B.E. degree in 
<a href="http://infosec.sjtu.edu.cn">Information Security</a> 
from <a href="http://www.sjtu.edu.cn">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> in 2013.

I am broadly interested in computer networking with a special focus on datacenter networking. I try to understand and improve network performance by building real systems.
I enjoy solving real world problems in a simple and practical style (so-called 'dirty-slate'  works). But I don't like (also not good at) writing papers. Actually, I define myself as a junior network developer. 
If you want to know more about me, please visit my <a href="http://sing.cse.ust.hk/~wei/">personal homepage</a>.
